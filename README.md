# Invoice Management System (Prototype)

A prototype web-based invoice management system for Company XYZ, allowing employees to submit invoices and managers to review them.

> **Note**: This is a prototype version with basic functionality. Some features may not be fully implemented.

## System Requirements

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Any of the following databases:
  - PostgreSQL 13 or later
  - SQL Server
  - SQLite (for development)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Project Structure

## Setup Instructions

1. **Automatic Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # The database will be automatically created and seeded
   # through DataSeedingService when the application starts
   # No manual setup or migrations needed
   ```

   > **Note**: The application uses Entity Framework Core and includes DataSeedingService
   > which automatically handles database creation and sample data population.

2. **Application Configuration**
   - Copy `appsettings.json.example` to `appsettings.json`
   - Update the connection string to match your database settings
   - Default configuration uses PostgreSQL for easy development setup

3. **Build and Run**
   ```bash
   # Restore dependencies
   dotnet restore

   # Build the solution
   dotnet build

   # Run the application
   cd src/InvoiceSystem.Web
   dotnet run
   ```

## Prototype Features Status

Currently implemented basic features:
- âœ… User authentication (login/logout)
- âœ… Basic role-based authorization
- âœ… Simple invoice submission
- âœ… Basic invoice listing
- âœ… Data seeding service for sample data

| employee2 | password123| Employee       |
| employee3 | password123| Employee       |

## Development Notes

- Uses Entity Framework Core with code-first approach
- Includes DataSeedingService for automatic database setup and sample data
- Basic cookie-based authentication implemented
- Password hashing using BCrypt
- Bootstrap 5 for basic UI styling

## Database Design

The `database design` directory contains documentation only:
- `schema.sql`: Reference schema documentation
- `seed-data.sql`: Reference sample data documentation
- `invoice Entity.drawio.pdf`: Entity relationship diagram
- `README.md`: Database documentation

> **Note**: Database creation and seeding is handled automatically by the application.
> The SQL scripts are provided as documentation only.
